Key Improvements Implemented:
	
1. File Hashing:
   • Uses SHA-256 for content verification
   • Hash comparison instead of mtime for modified files
   • Partial hash display in difference reports

2. Parallel Processing:
   • Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent copies
   • Configurable worker count (MAX_WORKERS)
   • Progress tracking during parallel operations

3. Retry Mechanism:
   • Exponential backoff retries for file operations
   • Configurable attempts (RETRY_ATTEMPTS) and delay (RETRY_DELAY)
   • Unified robust_copy function for all file operations

4. Progress Tracking:
   • Real-time progress updates
   • Size estimates and file counts
   • Visual progress percentage

5. Directory Size Estimation:
   • Shows total size in MB for directories
   • Calculates size differences in modified files
   • Size information in difference reports

6. Colorized Output:
   • Color-coded status messages
   • Improved visual hierarchy
   • Error/warning/success differentiation
   • ANSI color code support

Usage Notes:
   • Adjust MAX_WORKERS based on your CPU cores
   • Modify RETRY_ATTEMPTS and RETRY_DELAY as needed
   • Colors automatically disabled if terminal doesn't support them
   • Hash comparisons ensure content accuracy
   • Size calculations help predict operation duration
